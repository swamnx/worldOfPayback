Here some notes about application:

1) you can see all transactions on "transactions" tab
2) you can sort transactions by clicking on sortOption in header
3) you can filter transaction by clicking on filterOprion in header
4) the card with the sum appears, when any category filter is applied
4) you can scroll to update loading transactions
5) you can click on Card to go to Transaction details
6) App support Localization( Eng / Russian ) just for example
7) App support dark/light theme
8) App support listening to network, you will see the banner on "transactions" tab, that there is no network

P.s. I understand, that something can be done better, but i hope this level is enough for test app
